## Parallel autotrade
Parallel autotrade is a replacement for the `@autotrade` command that allows users to keep playing in the same account as their vending character. It's compatible with vending and buyinstores, as well as the searchstore functionality.

### Main differences with default `@autotrade`
- Allows users to play in other characters from the same account
- Allows several autotrade merchants or buyingstores per account
- Blazingly fast loading of merchants when persistency is enabled

> [!WARNING]
> Buyingstore searchstore functionality is only available when using these patches:
